## Recommended Hosting Path

### Current Static Website
For the current static website, **Netlify** or **Vercel** is recommended due to:
- Easy deployment process
- Free tier that meets current needs
- CDN for fast global access
- Simple integration with GitHub for continuous deployment

### Future Client Portal
When developing the client portal with user authentication and file management:
- **AWS** is recommended for its comprehensive services:
  - S3 for file storage
  - RDS for database
  - Cognito for user authentication
  - Lambda for serverless functions
- Alternatively, a combination of **DigitalOcean** (for servers) and **AWS S3** (for file storage) could be cost-effective

## Domain Configuration

### Registering a Domain
If you don't already have a domain registered:
1. Choose a domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains)
2. Search for availability of desired domain (vivaahweddings.com)
3. Purchase the domain (typically $10-15/year)

### Connecting Existing Domain to Hosting

#### For Netlify:
1. Go to Netlify site settings > Domain management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings:
   - Option 1: Use Netlify DNS (recommended)
     - Update nameservers at your registrar to Netlify's nameservers
   - Option 2: Keep existing DNS
     - Add CNAME record pointing to your Netlify site URL
     - Add A records if needed

#### For Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel project settings > Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed (similar to Netlify)

#### For Traditional Hosting:
1. Log in to your domain registrar
2. Update nameservers to those provided by your hosting company, or
3. Create A records pointing to your hosting IP address

### SSL Configuration
- Most modern hosting providers offer free SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt
- Ensure SSL is enabled in your hosting settings
- Force HTTPS redirection for all traffic

## Deployment Process

### Static Website Deployment

#### Git-based Deployment (Recommended):
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify/Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: None (for simple static sites)
   - Publish directory: Root directory or specific folder
3. Trigger deployments automatically when pushing to main/master branch

#### Manual Deployment:
1. Prepare your website files locally
2. Compress files into a ZIP archive
3. Upload to hosting provider via their control panel
4. Extract files to the web root directory

### Future Client Portal Deployment

#### Backend Deployment:
1. Set up a server environment (Node.js, PHP, etc.)
2. Configure database connections
3. Set up environment variables for sensitive information
4. Use a process manager (PM2 for Node.js) to keep the application running
5. Set up reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache

#### Frontend Deployment:
1. Build the frontend application (React, Vue, etc.)
2. Deploy static assets to CDN or web server
3. Configure routing for single-page applications

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
1. Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
2. Configure automated testing
3. Implement staging and production environments
4. Create deployment scripts for consistent deployments

## Scaling Considerations

### File Storage
- Start with standard hosting file storage
- As file uploads grow, transition to cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Implement CDN for frequently accessed files

### Database
- Begin with a standard database offering from your hosting provider
- Monitor performance and scale vertically (larger instance) or horizontally (read replicas) as needed

### Traffic
- Start with standard hosting
- Monitor traffic patterns
- Implement caching strategies
- Scale to cloud hosting if traffic demands increase

## Backup Strategy

### Regular Backups
- Configure automated daily backups of website files
- Set up database backups (if applicable)
- Store backups in multiple locations

### Disaster Recovery
- Document recovery procedures
- Test restoration process periodically
- Maintain backup hosting option for critical failures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Uptime Monitoring
- Set up monitoring with services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom
- Configure alerts for downtime

### Performance Monitoring
- Implement Google Analytics for user metrics
- Use tools like Lighthouse for performance auditing
- Consider New Relic or similar for application performance monitoring

### Regular Maintenance
- Schedule monthly maintenance windows
- Keep software and dependencies updated
- Review and optimize performance regularly

## Cost Management

### Startup Phase
- Begin with free or low-cost hosting options
- Utilize free tiers of cloud services where possible

### Growth Phase
- Transition to paid services as needs grow
- Monitor usage to avoid unexpected costs
- Implement cost alerts for cloud services

## Security Considerations

### Basic Security
- Keep all software updated
- Use strong passwords and 2FA for hosting accounts
- Implement proper file permissions

### Advanced Security (for Client Portal)
- Regular security audits
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Set up intrusion detection
- Conduct penetration testing

## Conclusion

The hosting strategy should evolve with the website's needs. Start simple with Netlify or Vercel for the static site, then transition to more robust solutions as the client portal is developed. Regularly review hosting performance and costs to ensure they align with business requirements.
